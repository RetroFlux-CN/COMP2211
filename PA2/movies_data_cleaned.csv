"A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars. A Gestapo officer undercover.<br /><br />It's a pity there's no synergy here. The bits and pieces never coalesce.<br /><br />Stories about left-wing refugees in France don't have to be this dull. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir ""Scum of the Earth"" (if you can find it). Or his chilling ""Dialogue With Death"" (ditto).<br /><br />To me, the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.<br /><br />The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself. It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly. But, according to the film, it's only sold in cheap, low-class saloons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.<br /><br />I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background. I wasn't disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.<br /><br />The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera ""The Emperor Jones"", based on the O'Neill play. It premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It should surface again soon though; they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer's character operates under his ""Czech"" aliases. Two of them are ""Wozzeck"" and ""Gunther"", both prominent roles in German opera. Is that just coincidence?<br /><br />Name-dropping just seems to be part of this film. Notice that they call up ""Himmelstoss"" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".<br /><br />Well, the in-jokes are all in place; guess there wasn't time to develop any drama.",0,a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a leftwing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercoverits a pity theres no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalescestories about leftwing refugees in france dont have to be this dull read arthur koestlers memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death dittoto me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental detailsthe leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film its only sold in cheap lowclass saloons vive le tabac parisien thats what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenaristsi enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable fullsize alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasnt disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze muralsthe films indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the oneill play it premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though theyre running out of potentially marketable operas to reviveopera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyers character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidencenamedropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarques earlier all quiet on the western frontwell the injokes are all in place guess there wasnt time to develop any drama
"Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots Piper, who dies. The source proposes Phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal, and the time is reverted to the moment Shax is attacking Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits.<br /><br />""All Hell Breaks Loose"" is a good but incoherent episode. With Piper dead and The Power of Three destroyed, why should The Source revert time to save her? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the Third Season and let the viewers anxiously waiting for the next episode.

"I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. Turns out I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this motion picture like Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds to being a burnout. Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW). Like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention! I love all y'all, and continue to support Marky Msrk because he needs us now more than ever.

"Explores the frontiers of extreme boredom. Life in a small Canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation. Absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank, deadpan, totally uninteresting protagonist. Viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of ""Altered States"".<br /><br />In a groundbreaking study, David Snowden found that he could predict Alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent. Those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose. The essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy.<br /><br />Now, why did I mention that? Perhaps , my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable, autobiographical, contemplative film which shows, in simple direct style, the bleak and stoic life of a small community, living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos.<br /><br />This film became popular at the height of the Quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims. Tragically, its writer-director was soon diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide.",0,explores the frontiers of extreme boredom life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank deadpan totally uninteresting protagonist viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of altered statesin a groundbreaking study david snowden found that he could predict alzheimers thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joynow why did i mention that perhaps my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable autobiographical contemplative film which shows in simple direct style the bleak and stoic life of a small community living next to giant slag heaps of asbestosthis film became popular at the height of the quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims tragically its writerdirector was soon diagnosed with alzheimers disease in the early s and apparently committed suicide
"Halfway through Lajos Koltai's ""Evening,"" a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: ""Can you tell me where my life went?"" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman speaking it is Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears your heart out.<br /><br />Time and again, the film based on Susan Minot's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have. With only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being Sara Polley's ""Away from Her."" Hollywood might have turned ""Evening"" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep's younger self, while Redgrave's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes.<br /><br />Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer of ""Mephisto,"" and director of ""Fateless"" - created a subtle ensemble work with a ""Continental feel,"" the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble.<br /><br />Missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, Koltai's direction, and selfless acting raise ""Evening"" way above that level, into the the rarified air of English, French (and a few American) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting.<br /><br />Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly. Individual tunes are woven into a symphony.<br /><br />And yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of ""Evening"" still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of admission too.<br /><br />As with ""Away from Her,"" ""Evening"" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises. At two hours, the film runs a bit long, but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn.",1,halfway through lajos koltais evening a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart outtime and again the film based on susan minots novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness it holds attention offers admirable performances and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara polleys away from her hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of reallife mothers and daughters vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and mamie gummer richardson is redgraves daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and gummer plays streeps younger self while redgraves youthful incarnation is claire danesadd glenn close eileen atkins hugh dancy patrick wilson and a large cast yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead koltai the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of mephisto and director of fateless created a subtle ensemble work with a continental feel the story taking place in a highsociety newport environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with troublemissed connections wrong choices and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing koltais direction and selfless acting raise evening way above that level into the the rarified air of english french and a few american family sagas from a century before its contemporary settingcomplex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably captivatingly individual tunes are woven into a symphonyand yet with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson gummer an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission tooas with away from her evening stays with you at length inviting a rethinking its story and characters and reexperiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
"Was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a great chat to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife.Fantastic after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted Jon.

"If you are having a bad day,or bad week. If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles. I don't think Role Models is that movie for you.<br /><br />The film centers around Danny(Paul Rudd) and Wheeler(Seann William Scott) Two juice promoters, who go to schools promoting the product, telling kids to stay off drugs, and more juice. But Danny is having the worst week ever, and crashes his company car, with Wheeler in the seat next to him. His soon to be ex girlfriend Beth(Elizabeth Banks) who is a lawyer, manages to avoid getting them jail time, by doing hours of community service, volunteering at a big brother place called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle(Jane Lynch). Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie(Bobb'e J Thompson) who is 10 years old, and has a foul mouth like he's Chris Rock. Danny is assigned to Augie(McLovins, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who likes to dress like a knight, and fight like he is in medieval times. But will this be good for Danny and Wheeler, or will they be better off in jail?<br /><br />Okay I'm not gonna beat around the bush, this movie was very unpleasant in many ways. Namely the Ronnie character, hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young, was very shocking. If he was a little bit older, it would not have mater'd as much. I mean what where his parents thinking, when they sign'd him on to this. Elizabeth Banks character is so unwatchable, maybe I was supposed to feel bad for her character, but I felt nothing, because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies. And Jane Lynch, who's the worst of the worst. She delivers the most overacting performance ever. Playing a former drug addict, who acts like she still is on drugs. Listening to her give all that annoying dialog, made me want to throw my head up against the wall. Seann William Scott once again playing another Stifler like character, he should really try to separate himself, and this film won't do it. And the more Scott tries to hard to be funny, is what keeps him from being funny.<br /><br />Now Paul Rudd on the other hand, I'm gonna separate from the others in the film, cause he manages to deliver a solid performance, although he does not get higher laughs, but he is the most interesting character from the rest. Cause Rudd does not overact, and does not try so hard. The scenes with him and Mintz-Plasse are watchable. But the rest of the film is so stupid, it picks up at times. But it becomes so predictable and uninteresting. It is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new, there all the same, they take no chances. Role Models is an example of that.",0,if you are having a bad dayor bad week if you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles i dont think role models is that movie for youthe film centers around dannypaul rudd and wheelerseann william scott two juice promoters who go to schools promoting the product telling kids to stay off drugs and more juice but danny is having the worst week ever and crashes his company car with wheeler in the seat next to him his soon to be ex girlfriend bethelizabeth banks who is a lawyer manages to avoid getting them jail time by doing hours of community service volunteering at a big brother place called sturdy wings led by gaylejane lynch wheeler is assigned to ronniebobbe j thompson who is years old and has a foul mouth like hes chris rock danny is assigned to augiemclovins christopher mintzplasse who likes to dress like a knight and fight like he is in medieval times but will this be good for danny and wheeler or will they be better off in jailokay im not_gonna beat around the bush this movie was very unpleasant in many ways namely the ronnie character hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young was very shocking if he was a little bit older it would not_have materd as much i mean what where his parents thinking when they signd him on to this elizabeth banks character is so unwatchable maybe i was supposed to feel bad for her character but i felt nothing because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies and jane lynch whos the worst of the worst she delivers the most overacting performance ever playing a former drug addict who acts like she still is on drugs listening to her give all that annoying dialog made me want to throw my head up against the wall seann william scott once again playing another stifler like character he should really try to separate himself and this film wont do it and the more scott tries to hard to be funny is what keeps him from being funnynow paul rudd on the other hand im gonna separate from the others in the film cause he manages to deliver a solid performance although he does not_get higher laughs but he is the most interesting character from the rest cause rudd does not_overact and does not_try so hard the scenes with him and mintzplasse are watchable but the rest of the film is so stupid it picks up at times but it becomes so predictable and uninteresting it is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new there all the same they take no chances role models is an example of that
"Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself, an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950, a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned, would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas, and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama, with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty, but--although the camera loves her pouty, glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth, one is inclined to either cringe or duck. *1/2 from ****",0,peter fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose linereadings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue he trades sassy barbs and nonwitty repartee with brooke shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair even his smaller touches like fingering a nonexistent mustache on his grizzled face dont reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker in the southwest circa a poor gambler not_above a little cheating wins an orphaned wouldbe teen lolita in a botched poker game after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the grand canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by henry fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedydrama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map shields is very pretty butalthough the camera loves her pouty glossy beautyshe has no screen presence and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck from
"Being a huge fan of Conte d'ete ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/ ) I was expecting to be wowed by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism, and humor. Same director, same actress- what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment. It's very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters, was meaningful, or original. But it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least ""character change"" with regards to Pauline. The source material is standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation) but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting. Unfortunately that's not the case. Event though there are other shortcomings with Rohmer's season cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one.",0,being a huge fan of conte dete httpwwwimdbcomtitlett i was expecting to be wowed by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor same director same actress what could go wrong unfortunately pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment its very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original but it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to pauline the source material is standard fare sexual awakening during a beach vacation but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting unfortunately thats not_the case event though there are other shortcomings with rohmers season cycle most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one

"Long trailer? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded, but there's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good, but incomplete compared to this one. for instance, it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary, but that is explained in Revisited. the Revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she's letting the crew down. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that ""just a long trailer"" review and go check it out for yourself. you won't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply...",1,long trailer whoever said that has got to be joking this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them then it shows us how woo pings team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded but theres hardly anything really if you are a real fan of the matrix you have to see this documentary the original documentary in the dvd is good but incomplete compared to this one for instance it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary but that is explained in revisited the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like shes letting the crew down and thats just the tip of the iceberg so ignore that just a long trailer review and go check it out for yourself you wont regret it casual matrix fans need not_apply
"and anyone who watches this film will agree. This film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered.<br /><br />Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in top form as informer ""Moe"" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police.<br /><br />The only other film in which I have seen Peters is ""Niagara"", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash.<br /><br />The photography is brilliant. The neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient. Excellent use is made of the city, with ""Lightning Louie"" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.",1,and anyone who watches this film will agree this film was directed in the days when plot character believability and theme actually matteredjean peters widmark and thelma ritter steal the spotlight ritter is in top form as informer moe she survives in the bowery section of ny acting as a stool pigeon for nyc policethe only other film in which i have seen peters is niagara and she certainly proves her acting ability here complete with brooklyn accent widmark is appropriately menacing as the antihero who must discern what the right thing is despite his need for cashthe photography is brilliant the neon the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient excellent use is made of the city with lightning louie in chinatown the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop
"If you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie (bad in the way only Ken Russell at his worst can be), you must try this one. It succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth, and you can just about smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner struts around in a blond wig, getting her kicks from ""pretending"" to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical ""priest"" who is out to maybe murderer her (yet another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in drag).

"I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a ride! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.",1,i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet now ive seen the film what a ride and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems such a courageous wise funny and talented spirit and what a crew to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon the excitement of rafting through some rapids the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi and the phone calls home and as always boys will be boys this film needs to be seen by everyone young and old alike darius and his mother are models of strength and courage and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation they got darius a new wheelchair they documented accessibility problems they took darius on the trip of his life and they touched many many lives by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west a cure for dmd
"The entire movie, an artful adaptation of one of Joyce's ""Dubliners"" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of upper-class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. While there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. The poignant final scene, between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, ""The Dead"" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th. After many viewings it never fails to move me, and each time I glean something that I've missed before.",1,the entire movie an artful adaptation of one of joyces dubliners stories takes place on the night of january epiphany most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters two sisters and their niece where a group of upperclass dubliners gather for an evening of music recitations and dinner while there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about dublin in the early th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning the cast all talented irish stage actors with the exception of anjelica huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself the poignant final scene between ms huston and the amazing donal mccann reveals much about the marriage of the characters there is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies the dead is highly recommended my wife is from dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january th after many viewings it never fails to move me and each time i glean something that ive missed before

"My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thought. I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom. My wife has double the attention span that I do. All that being said-- this film is just plain empty and BORING! It went nowhere. Never blossomed. It started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts & dead ends. We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space. Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz...... It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy. You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all. About halfway through you just don't care anymore.

"<br /><br />As a Harold Lloyd fan, i agree with the other reviewer's comments, EXCEPT that I feel that ""Movie Crazy"" was his best sound film; ""Cat's Paw"" is a close second. (But, this is just MY opinion).<br /><br />This film is a ""hoot"" from beginning to end and, in many scenes, George Barbier (the crook that gets him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the film).<br /><br />One wishes that Una Merkel's character would be a bit more sympathetic to Harold, especially as the film progresses. Only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him. (And, even then, there is no ""romance"" - kissing, etc).<br /><br />This is a Must-See film!",1,as a harold lloyd fan i agree with the other reviewers comments except that i feel that movie crazy was his best sound film cats paw is a close second but this is just my opinionthis film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes george barbier the crook that gets him elected mayor almost steals the show especially at the end of the filmone wishes that una merkels character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold especially as the film progresses only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him and even then there is no romance kissing etcthis is a mustsee film

"This documentary was my first introduction to Peak Oil theory. A fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the American way of life is dependent on the ""abundance of cheap oil"" - a term used throughout the film. A lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. But you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this film is meant to scare people. It's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.<br /><br />After watching this film I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same.

"This movie is so bad it's good -- in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn't stop watching it, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /><br />Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Mind you, he's no worse than the other actors. You get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they're in a really awful film; they're playing it straight. Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then Luke's final words to Emily -- I was howling with laughter. <br /><br />Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso. That's probably the highlight of the film.",0,this movie is so bad its good in an unintentionally funny way i couldnt stop watching it i was laughing so much its like a parody of a romantic thriller except its not_a parody alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preachers wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you hes no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea theyre in a really awful film theyre playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then lukes final words to emily i was howling with laughter evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso thats probably the highlight of the film
"Okay, I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller, although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. This movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot?? Can we say ""Forces of Nature??"" Not only is the plot so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. It was a bore, but watching Stiller is always a delight!!!",0,okay i absolutely love ben stiller although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston i do not_think this girl can act in the least every movie or sitcom ive seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script this movie only had one good thing about it and thats that ben stiller was in it this plot is so used and abused its ridiculous how many movies have this same type of plot can we say forces of nature not_only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable its boring i knew everything that was going to happen before it did it was a bore but watching stiller is always a delight
"First, the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading, the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker, who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he holds them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence ensues.<br /><br />I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie ""The Hitcher"". Not that The Hitcher is any better, and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but this was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.<br /><br />I can't even count how many movies I've seen with virtually the same storyline, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood, and two police officers, at the scene because of a 911 call, are looking at it from 30 feet away, see a man, also covered in blood, walk out of the door, agree that it looks suspicious, but decide to not investigate further.<br /><br />But, however ridiculous it may be, the movie was never boring, was well produced, directed, and acted, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudity, and violence. I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.",0,first the current imdb plot description seems to be misleading the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all they stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls violence ensuesi picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other movie the hitcher not_that the hitcher is any better and i was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway but this was almost unbearable at times i think i could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than thisi cant even count how many movies ive seen with virtually the same storyline so this was almost painfully predictable at times but what really made it awful were a few scenes that well let me give an example at one point a door is covered in what is very obviously blood and two police officers at the scene because of a call are looking at it from feet away see a man also covered in blood walk out of the door agree that it looks suspicious but decide to not_investigate furtherbut however ridiculous it may be the movie was never boring was well produced directed and acted complete with good special effects gratuitous nudity and violence i probably would not_recommend actually spending minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie but it turned out to be perfect to have on while i cleaned my basement also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching

"Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I'll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours I'll never get back.

"When I borrowed this movie, I wasn't expecting a high-quality performance, but this was just sad.<br /><br />Most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. There's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like ""Oh no! My Dad is invisible!"" or ""I wonder what this does?"" in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts.<br /><br />The story is decent, though it would be fairly easy to guess, considering that there aren't too many real plot changes. Lots of holes, too. For example, the Dad is invisible, and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again. So the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. Couldn't he just ask his Dad for the cash?<br /><br />This shows up in the Comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb, like the Invisible Dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking around with his head covered at all times. Funny at first, but it gets old.<br /><br />2/5, because it is watchable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way... like the monotone recitation of lines.",0,when i borrowed this movie i wasnt expecting a highquality performance but this was just sadmost of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldnt easily get into this movie if you tried theres nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller partsthe story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there arent too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store couldnt he just ask his dad for the cashthis shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets old because it is watchable and its one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines

"Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in ""Double Indemnity"" the year before. That film, while the premiere ""film noir"" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman. She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say ""Jingle Bells"". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. ""It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew"". Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, ""Now it's goulash"", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. ""I don't flip. I scoop!"". She won't even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying ""I've never flipped in me life."" O'Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming.<br /><br />It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but doesn't. But it doesn't matter. The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life.<br /><br />This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, ""Remember the Night"", an underrated gem. Add on the big city Christmas of ""Meet John Doe"", and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around.",1,barbara stanwyck probably didnt think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle if it wasnt a wig than the one she had to wear in double indemnity the year before that film while the premiere film noir and an allaround great film gave her a great role but oh that hair here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a s woman she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful martha stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is we meet her boss sydney greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a christmas away at her supposed connecticut home she has to come up with a husband reginald gardiner and baby before we can say jingle bells hungarian chef sz sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie oneonone with irish una oconnor its not_goulash its irish stew sakall simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says now its goulash totally changing what she has prepared for lunch then when it comes to the flapjacks he flips and she scoops for years a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation i dont flip i scoop she wont even flip just one for greenstreet saying ive never flipped in me life oconnor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with sakall is very charmingit is obvious in the romance department that reginald gardiner is not_barbara stanwycks cup of tea especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing stanwyck to get a bit alarmed he should suspect something instantly but doesnt but it doesnt matter the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up living in new york city after years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at rockefeller center is exsquisit too there is something about looking out at a snowcovered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild lifethis is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film remember the night an underrated gem add on the big city christmas of meet john doe and youve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around
"Follow-up to 1965's ""My Name Is Barbra"", and shot in brilliant color, ""Color Me Barbra"" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (""One Kiss"", ""Yesterdays""). The circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip (with the conceit of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea which works better than you may think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word ""face""!) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special--not quite as emotionally tantalizing as ""My Name Is Barbra"", but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.",1,followup to s my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazyquilt hour of showbiz razzle dazzle shes a cutup and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma with her egyptian eye makeup and everchanging hairstyles shes also a chameleon her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss yesterdays the circus sequence isnt as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circusmedley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively jazzy specialnot_quite as emotionally tantalizing as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** After two so-so outings (""Magnum Force"" and ""The Enforcer""), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in ""Sudden Impact,"" a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.<br /><br />For once, the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his ""shoot first, ask questions later"" tactics), to the hamlet of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.<br /><br />The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke, and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.<br /><br />The rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has ""psycho nutjob"" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. The flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants.<br /><br />Some will dismiss ""Sudden Impact"" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. On a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash. What works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view.<br /><br />You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare.<br /><br />The movie's other redeeming quality is Eastwood's direction. This is, after all, a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. Some of the best ""Harry moments"" in the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, ""Go ahead -- make my day.""<br /><br />""Sudden Impact"" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. And it is certainly never dull.

"How could a film dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull? Well, ""Border Incident"" is.<br /><br />No wonder that song and dance man George Murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out.

"For all intents and purposes, 'Teen Devian' might seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.<br /><br />This is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. Dev Anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. There are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.",1,for all intents and purposes teen devian might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical to some extent this might even be true especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses but somewhere behind the scenes either sadashiv brahmam who had the idea for this story or amerjeet who directed the film decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectationsthis is not_simply about a handsome man flirting with women undecided on whom to choose as his lifes partner dev anands character was really in love with each of the women at various times and they with him despite being aware of the other two dev anands relationship with simi and kalpana is particularly interesting in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewers maturity the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism
"So i had low expectations for this movie to start with, but it failed to meet even those. while there were some funny parts, even one or two laugh out loud parts, this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly, leaving us sitting there going ""WTF just happened?"" in addition, there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on. the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning. also, the editing was really lacking. there were some poor scene transitions, but that seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but i wouldn't watch it again, and I'm very glad i waited for it to rent. give it a chance, you might enjoy it, but don't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin, or Superbad.",0,so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldnt watch it again and im very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but dont think you are in for anything along the lines of the year old virgin or superbad
"It is very possible that I simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me (something similar happened with Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have caught on when I put the film on and my roommate, an exchange student from Japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded dumb. Now, I don't agree that it is dumb, the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled. It's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time.<br /><br />But the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me. It has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. The sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits, for example, are indeed repulsive.<br /><br />There was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. There is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it.<br /><br />As I said about Triplets of Belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night TV program like adult swim, or its Japanese counterpart, but an Academy Award nominated film? It gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose from.",0,it is very possible that i simply didnt give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me something similar happened with triplets of belleville but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate an exchange student from japan immediately started laughing at the movie saying that it sounded dumb now i dont agree that it is dumb the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled its like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same timebut the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me it has an interesting message about stinginess and greed but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not_worth learning especially because you already knew it anyway the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits for example are indeed repulsivethere was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about itas i said about triplets of belleville this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim or its japanese counterpart but an academy award nominated film it gives me the impression that there is not_generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from
"I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only ""serious"" film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through. Once we reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, I think everyone gave up.<br /><br />The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting. Oh, and there's also Bo's breasts, although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial.<br /><br />The ""dramatic tension"" in this film is between Bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent ""action"" sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those films that's bad enough, it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor.

"I wasn't sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad it was actually very funny. I'm not a Gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />But on topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films.<br /><br />The movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them.<br /><br />The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie.<br /><br />It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell.<br /><br />If this review is making you mad, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love?

"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy.

"This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. The story of this film was: Dave's going on a business trip to Europe and sticks the boys with Miss Miller. While playing an Around the World in 80 Days video game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), round the Chipmunks and Chipettes into an adventure in which the kids must hot-air-balloon their way across the globe. What they're unaware of is that the ""game"" is really a diamond-smuggling ring. And when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! And which ends in Klaus and Claudia off to jail and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I am warning you now, this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that. Most people hate musicals, but I am not one of those people, I frigging love musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Don't Dance, and just about anything (except for My Fair Lady).

"""ASTONISHING"" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There is an awful lot of talking b*ll**ks, a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, chopping them into bits...<br /><br />You get the picture. Considering there is no acting talent on display at all, and the gore is laughably unrealistic, what is the point of this whole farrago?

"""Visitor Q"" is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter, etc. The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following. However, with home video quality and a slapdash production, ""Visitor Q"" just doesn't hold up even as a curiosity. Genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible, make-up is awful, and everything else is amateurish at best. A waste of time.

"Growing up as of child of the movies, one of the trilogies I shall not soon forget is that of the Karate Kid. You can put down Ralph / Daniel all you want, but its the message behind the movies that are important, that its important to be respectful to all creatures great and small, but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it. Getting back to the movie at hand, its rather funny because, I saw Boys Don't Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank, and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night, I came across the showing of this film and I hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story centers around Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her.

Sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing. I made an error to watch this one sober. You'll probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). If you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie, you definitely will after the second.....;-)<br /><br />Problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest. And what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and.....at night? That's just their luck. They find a house and one got shot, one of the watchers stays behind (why I do not know) and the rest eventually finds another house. In that house a voodoo priestess lives.....but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is it then?

"This little film brings back a lot of memories, both fond and foul, of what can and does happen when one is a working musician. The not so pleasant accommodations for the band, the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of the applause.............. Far from being farcical it is, in fact, very accurate in the way it depicts musicians, professional and otherwise, who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue. There are those times when everything goes perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home. In the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out.",1,this little film brings back a lot of memories both fond and foul of what can and does happen when one is a working musician the not_so pleasant accommodations for the band the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play the sheer ecstasy of the applause far from being farcical it is in fact very accurate in the way it depicts musicians professional and otherwise who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue there are those times when everything goes perfectly there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home in the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out
"(SPOILERS IN THIS)<br /><br />""Rosenstraße"" is a movie about heroic women in German Nazi time. But it is way too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting.<br /><br />The storytelling (storyline) is bad. Like in James Cameron´s Titanic an old woman remembers events of her live. Good, now we´ve got a point of view. Than there is another woman introduced who does the same. Confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...How can Riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for example?<br /><br />The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. For example the scene when Riemann is proposing to Fabian. When did that happen? The scene looks like it is set in the Twenties...<br /><br />Riemann´s character is of course a talented pianist, well, she is even a Baroness! Wow. Her brother comes back from the Eastern Front, he has received a ""Ritterkreuz"" which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even made some photographs! And so it goes, cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.<br /><br />Basically von Trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. And in the end it´s all very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free. Which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the ""true story"" claim at the beginning. Like ""Sass"" it is vaguely BASED on a true event.<br /><br />It is sad but true, this IS the typical German movie these days. It is bad! Macaulay J.

"We thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to watch the end. The romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION...just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the OUTERBANKS does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. Also..it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.<br /><br />Also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story What did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? I also have to mention the wardrobe...did D. Lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene? It was overdone. She looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacks.<br /><br />Lastly I am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid, and I mean STUPID movie!!!!

"I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure. Like the ""films"" of Edward Wood, Jr. in the '60s and '70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right. This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios' pre-screening process. If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.<br /><br />Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is ""good enough"" can truly be. Every performance, every line of dialog, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity. A beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think ""At least I accomplished SOMETHING"" or ""Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself"". This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.<br /><br />Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment ""the worst movie ever made"".<br /><br />Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are, and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites. Also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story. Writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think ""I can do better than THAT"" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results.<br /><br />I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers. Particularly those entering the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment. There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects. The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off. Some can't even come CLOSE to it.",0,i honestly believe that anyone considering filmmaking be subjected to this mindboggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the s and s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts reediting their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios prescreening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut or the walkingrunningstrolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable minutesfilm students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himselfherself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn outcritics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever madebeginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad madeforcable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre resultsi sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current postlucas and postspielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not_everyone can pull it off some cant even come close to it
"Husband-and-wife doctor team Carole and Niles Nelson are doing modestly well in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. Loving his change of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), Niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well.<br /><br />At this point the plot comes into focus, as Carole Nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single- handedly. <br /><br />This is not a hard-edged gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but the mood is kept light by Bogart's tongue-in-cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the ""Napoleon of Crime."" His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums. And there's some snappy dialog between Bogart and Francis, especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout. Of course, as in all gangster flicks, there's a big shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom.",1,husbandandwife doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers but niles has a gambling problem his luck changes when he unknowingly saves the life of a gangster from joe gurneys mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself loving his change of fortune and snazzy new apartment niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wifes career as wellat this point the plot comes into focus as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single handedly this is not_a hardedged gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote there is some tension but the mood is kept light by bogarts tongueincheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the napoleon of crime his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums and theres some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when shes treating his injuries at his hideout of course as in all gangster flicks theres a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom
"Oddly enough, it's Fred MacMurray who plays the more ""screwy"" part in this screwball comedy. Carole Lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness.<br /><br />As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is no fan of his, he's not that attractive, and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very Cary Grant-like role.<br /><br />Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with Lombard's character. One can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle, reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of MacMurray's ineptness. But that's Hollywood!<br /><br />The picture almost works but misses the mark, primarily due to MacMurray's performance. It would've been lovely to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely believable and likable; MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.",0,oddly enough its fred macmurray who plays the more screwy part in this screwball comedy carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousnessas usual fred macmurray remains a mystery to me the camera is no fan of his hes not_that attractive and he doesnt have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grantlike roleralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombards character one can only wonder why her character wouldnt want his gentle reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurrays ineptness but thats hollywoodthe picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to macmurrays performance it wouldve been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arms length
"I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler ""Happy Madison"" production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.<br /><br />There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing.

"This is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, ""Watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick."".<br /><br />What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many that can pull it off like Bob Hoskins but he isn't in this one. It wasn't even necessary to choose North America as a location why not say it took place in England or something? The director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and asses more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation. So at this point you drunken buddies will be saying, ""ALL RIGHT! Another T&A shot!"". There isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those sandwiches. What did I like about this movie?

"I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local Suncoast, which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks (including its sequel ""Witchcraft XI""). So basically I paid the rock bottom price of $2.50 for this movie, if you do the math. I can't exactly say I was ripped off. I have a thing for trashy horror movies, but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name. The budget couldn't be over $1,000 (though it appears as if they spent a total of $1.50). I know it's a low-budget film, but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork. The film ""Blood Cult,"" though not very good, was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting. The acting in this movie is the definition of ""effortless,"" especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing. I said before that I've never seen a bad English actor. This movie has quite a few bad ones. And though English movies aren't always good, they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication, which is why I don't see why any Englishman, or Englishwoman, would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing, acting and cinematography departments. Even when you watch a movie like ""Glitter"" you can't honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes (though a third-grader could've written the script). I've seen home movies that are shot better than ""Witchcraft X,"" and that's no exaggeration whatsoever. Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City. Not a single effort was put into making this movie--let's just sum it up like that. You get the picture. There's a good deal of nudity, though that doesn't save it. However, I must say that girl with the red-orange hair, who's either naked or wearing a cleavage-popping outfit throughout the film, is really hot! <br /><br />My score: 1 (out of 10)",0,i bought a set of dvds for bucks at my local suncoast which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft xi so basically i paid the rock bottom price of for this movie if you do the math i cant exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldnt be over though it appears as if they spent a total of i know its a lowbudget film but thats no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork the film blood cult though not_very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of effortless especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that figuratively or literally i wouldnt be surprised if the script was offcamera as they were performing i said before that ive never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies arent always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i dont see why any englishman or englishwoman would volunteer to do a homevideostyle schlock flick like this did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing acting and cinematography departments even when you watch a movie like glitter you cant honestly say it looks like a thirdgrader shot those scenes though a thirdgrader couldve written the script ive seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and thats no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not_a single effort was put into making this movielets just sum it up like that you get the picture theres a good deal of nudity though that doesnt save it however i must say that girl with the redorange hair whos either naked or wearing a cleavagepopping outfit throughout the film is really hot my score out of

"Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well. These two truly enhance each other. Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote. I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes for a powerful experience!",1,richard brooks excellent film of truman capotes novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffmans oscar winning performance in the capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote id suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience
"You know what they say about the 70's..if you can remember them you weren't there. One of the few things I do remember about the 70's was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally 'underground'or counter-culture perspective..The Groove Tube. If the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isn't 'fresh' anymore..but hey! When this movie came out it was a first..and some of these skits were being done for the very first time...at a time when Nixon was in office, the Vietnam war was raging, the sexual revolution was in full swing..and J.Edgar Hoover was still in charge of the FBI. This is a film made before Watergate broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big swipe at the establishment..to make fun of it and the hippies at the same time.

We had been raised on Ozzie & Harriet ""Leave It to Beaver"", Father Knows Best, My Three Sons..Happy Days...so imagine our glee when those of us who were experimenting with the new life-styles got to see a send up of the box as seen from our perspective!

"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. (The makers of ""You've Got Mail"" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find ""The Shop Around the Corner"" to be nothing short of wonderful. Just as good with repeat viewings.

"OK..this movie could have been soooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.<br /><br />The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical.

"I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon-wand.<br /><br />I was wrong!<br /><br />The pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. The accessibility is marvelous! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.<br /><br />Don't be mistaken: ""Caprica"" is not BSG. We are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. <br /><br />The casting maintains BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.<br /><br />If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.",1,i must admit i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it i determined that it was going to be a cheap spinoff guided by ronald d moore wielding the retconwandi was wrongthe pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers the accessibility is marvelous of course seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war years before the events of the bsg pilot the pilot also allows for newcomers clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episodedont be mistaken caprica is not_bsg we are presented with an immersive cerebral drama dotted by provocative daring and controversial ideas the casting maintains bsgs standards stoltz and morales are simply astounding morales portrayal of joseph adama inspired by olmos portrayal of william gives a wonderful glimpse of williams heroic father stoltzs portrayal of dr graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questionsif the quality of the pilot is any indication of whats yet to come rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsgs legacy of firstrate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece
"I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, I even wet myself a little. When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past. This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. He can raise my kid I'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.",0,i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off when watching it i got the chills i even wet myself a little when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr norris mailbox he can raise my kid im not_letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life
"i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend, but after i did go see it, it was simply amazing; the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money. You also get to see different habitats, different vegetation, animals, and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world, of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere. You don't have to be an earth lover or a tree-hugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living.

"I've seen comments from Turkish people (which I'm not) saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that is exactly what this movie was to me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a greater impact. But if you're not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this.<br /><br />""Distant"" seems to lag on forever. Many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose. I don't understand the director's objectives in even including many of the scenes. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment, and friends in making the movie...Well guess what? It shows. It looks low budget. The acting is poor.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face for taking this role. I was physically ill after watching this film. I really don't understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. That way the worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. The gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. Glad I avoided this film and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid January releases at all cost.,0,this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role i was physically ill after watching this film i really dont understand hollywood sometimes there are so many people trying to break in that im sure you can skim off the top and get the very best that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost
"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I didn't go in with high expectations, but as soon as it started I thought it might be o-k. It wasn't. Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as though he were some diabolic cartoon character. The other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden. The plot has a good basis, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid. I was laughing during the whole second half of the movie, and after five minutes of that I got tired of that. Most plot 'twists' you could see from several miles off. It's just not worth watching.

"***SPOILERS*** Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950's. Back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children, especially teen-agers, needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, to their growing up problems, which is what 16 year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur never got from his successful movie producer dad Mr.Tom Ditmar, James Daly.<br /><br />Never really connecting with his dad Hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his dad put Hal down about him wanting to borrow his car, a late model luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drive in Hal's beat up and barley operational 1930's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick.<br /><br />Feeling like striking out at the world Hal acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple, Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and Jerry trying to watch the movie. This leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater, without even getting his money back, but when Grebbs tries to grab him Hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser.<br /><br />Hal now in real hot water, he's charged with assault and battery, put's on his ""James Dean"" act, at the local police station, making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done; almost knocked Mr. Grebbs teeth out. It's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done.<br /><br />The rest of the film has Hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him. Begging his father to understand that what he did, in belting Mr. Grebbs, was in self-defense Hal's father acts as if he's been there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation.<br /><br />Not excusing what Hal did, in laying out Mr. Grebbs, he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mom, to really turn too Hal slowly loses it only to later have both Sgt. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to drop the assault charge. You would think that by now Hal's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson, more then a stretch behind bars, that Hal's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored! Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors.<br /><br />Things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs gets belted, ending up with a butte of a shiner, again by Hal who, going back to Grebbs theater, tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he first, not the second time around, clobbered him. In the end Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems. But most of all Hal's father Mr. Ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail-keeper and a sugar daddy. Like the song says ""All you need s Love"" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar, until the very end of the movie, lacked the most off.",1,spoilers well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of america back in the s back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children especially teenagers needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family they also needed love and attention to their growing up problems which is what yearold hal ditmar james macarthur never got from his successful movie producer dad mrtom ditmar james dalynever really connecting with his dad hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom helen ditmar kim hunter as well as from society after his dad put hal down about him wanting to borrow his car a late model luxury sedan he and his friend jerry jeffery silver drive in hals beat up and barley operational s jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flickfeeling like striking out at the world hal acts like a real firstclass jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple eddie ryder jean corbett sitting in front of him and jerry trying to watch the movie this leads hal as well as his friend jerry to not_only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager mr grebbs whit bissell it turned out that at least hal was willing to leave the theater without even getting his money back but when grebbs tries to grab him hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisserhal now in real hot water hes charged with assault and battery puts on his james dean act at the local police station making like hes either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what hes done almost knocked mr grebbs teeth out its when sgtshipley james gergory tells hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what hes donethe rest of the film has hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him begging his father to understand that what he did in belting mr grebbs was in selfdefense hals father acts as if hes been there at the theater and saw the whole incident with his son hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocationnot_excusing what hal did in laying out mr grebbs he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both mr grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration gebbs in the fact that he provoked hal and mr ditmas in not_even bothering to hear him out feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone but his mom to really turn too hal slowly loses it only to later have both sgt shipley and mr grabbs agree to drop the assault charge you would think that by now hals has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson more then a stretch behind bars that hals so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored being there when his son needed him most and in that mr ditmar failed with flying colorsthings do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after mr grebbs gets belted ending up with a butte of a shiner again by hal who going back to grebbs theater tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that hal was only defending himself when he first not_the second time around clobbered him in the end hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not_letting his problems become other peoples problems but most of all hals father mr ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jailkeeper and a sugar daddy like the song says all you need s love to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son hal that mr ditmar until the very end of the movie lacked the most off
"I thought that this is a wonderfully written movie. I love little Scamp, and the street-wise Angel. This movie is very easy for little kids to understand, but a good movie for adults as well. I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and that movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation, and unforgettable classic characters. I have loved the movie ever since I saw it for the first time. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with. My favorite song in the movie was Always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original Lady and the Tramp.",1,i thought that this is a wonderfully written movie i love little scamp and the streetwise angel this movie is very easy for little kids to understand but a good movie for adults as well i liked this movie because it continues the original lady and the tramp and that movie is a classic lady and the tramp scamps adventure was filled with new characters catchy songs brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters i have loved the movie ever since i saw it for the first time i also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character it also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with my favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel i definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original lady and the tramp
"Beautifully photographed and ably acted, generally, but the writing is very slipshod. There are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for instance, is so contrived that I groaned out loud. And the ""emotion-light bulb connection"" seems gimmicky, too.<br /><br />I don't know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No major effort on the part of the viewer required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.",0,beautifully photographed and ably acted generally but the writing is very slipshod there are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching the fact that the young lover has a twin brother for instance is so contrived that i groaned out loud and the emotionlight bulb connection seems gimmicky tooi dont know though if you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes this is a pretty good movie no major effort on the part of the viewer required but italian film especially italian comedy is usually much much better than this
"I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a ""character study"" type of movie, so I struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the Stop button.<br /><br />Even with a character study theme, I just could not get into this film at all. Perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but setting that aside, I tried my best to move on to finish watching, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. About the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue. I think this movie should have been entitled, ""Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?"" Scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.<br /><br />Since I didn't finish watching it I'd say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe. To me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time. I'll leave it up to you to try it, but it's not one I'd strongly recommend.",0,i rented this on dvd yesterday and did not_realize it was a character study type of movie so i struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the stop buttoneven with a character study theme i just could not_get into this film at all perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else or maybe i had other expectations but setting that aside i tried my best to move on to finish watching but gave up the actors played their roles well but the global combination did not_come together to keep my interest about the only interesting thing was the sergeants gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one and spray painted it black to appear as police issue i think this movie should have been entitled who stole the sergeants gun scenes were well done but putting them together i once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewingsince i didnt finish watching it id say there is some merit to renting this film maybe to me it was a waste of good viewing effort and time ill leave it up to you to try it but its not_one id strongly recommend

"Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. A sin with it's used by people who have no idea what their doing. Sadly, that's not the only thing that's used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip-off.<br /><br />Ok, anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a cute guy in said low-budget movie, I'll usually point them out. So, let's just get this out of the way right now. This is one low-budget horror movie I didn't like. The acting, for the most part, is horrible, effects laughable, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've witnessed this year. As far as the resident cute boy...Dax Miller (Bog) wins that prize hands down. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt...he can actually act (well, as much as he can in this odious film). Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way, let's get on with it.<br /><br />In Cliff Notes version, here's the story (don't worry, I'll try not to give anything away)...<br /><br />A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers (established cute boy and his buddy) who surf with sharks. Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island. Croc shows up, mayhem ensues, and people are eaten. Roll end credits.<br /><br />As I said earlier, this film pretty much blows. It started pretty well, but soon devolved into being silly and stupid. A main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heros utter one-liners at the victims expense. Also, if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water, what's with all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around. The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. The CGI is horrendous, and they've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. You obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film. And what's with the pirate/drug pusher gang? Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top? <br /><br />It's funny how we get little sub-genres in the movie world. With Alligator and it's sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now looks like ""over-sized crocodile/alligator"" movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's Crocodile was good.

"Slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot. Special ops team is sent into south America to hunt down blood sucking natives. Their leader is a real old man who has aged well. There's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. Lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film. It looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood. While each member of the cast brought their own talents, it really didn't all click as a film. The effects were OK, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires. If you're looking for lots of blood and violence, this is for you.",0,slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot special ops team is sent into south america to hunt down blood sucking natives their leader is a real old man who has aged well theres an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film it looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood while each member of the cast brought their own talents it really didnt all click as a film the effects were ok except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires if youre looking for lots of blood and violence this is for you
"The movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point.<br /><br />Several questions are raised by this movie. First of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfying explanation for why the NSA decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me. It is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step.<br /><br />If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps, we was well-trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either.<br /><br />The various other loose ends out there are: 1. So, a rogue CIA agent has him released and flown back home. What prevents the NSA from picking him up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom, why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid anyways. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house.<br /><br />The whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But when you think about it with any more depth, there is nothing of substance in this movie, only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of ""what, that is it?!!!"" at the end of the movie.",0,the movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition torture and the politics of the war on terror others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie my review may contain spoilers so if you havent seen the movie you may not_want to read beyond this pointseveral questions are raised by this movie first of all was the protagonist guilty or not there is no satisfying explanation for why the nsa decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the nsa thinks is a terrorist if there is the movie does not_seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me it is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person then we will take it to the next stepif the protagonist was guilty then what was achieved by releasing him perhaps we was welltrained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty however there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty eitherthe various other loose ends out there are so a rogue cia agent has him released and flown back home what prevents the nsa from picking him up again a little publicity in the washington post please give me a break here if a senator is not_willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf what does corinne whitman have to fear if the nsa has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom why couldnt they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed the plot is even more stupid anyways any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line not_on one that can be traced back to him and his housethe whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture but when you think about it with any more depth there is nothing of substance in this movie only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of what that is it at the end of the movie
"Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors. The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job. John Abraham, what is wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood. Asrani a great talent, but overdoes his bit as before.<br /><br />Screenplay which was not to mention a rip-off from the 1965's Boeing Boeing was quite badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood just can't make something original. On top of that they don't even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so overdone, it was getting painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is amazingly crappy. I can go on and on this matter, but the bottom-line is that Bollywood should be shameful of making such a film.<br /><br />The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What is wrong with you guys? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one. I am an Indian and I am utterly shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific. They are world class films which are timeless... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century.

He plays Alex Finch, a 22 year old Yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the re-incarnation of Louie Jeffries, a no-nonsense lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car. He demands to go back, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughs.<br /><br />Although this movie is 15-years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation.

All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as an after school special. Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.,0,all i can say after watching snitchd is please stop mr cahill it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research its comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speaki laughed at the part when mr cahill goes to a school with only students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from i suspect real gangbangers do not_wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related snitchd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made

"It could not have come from a different country nor from a different time. This movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s Italian cinema. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight. Plus we get the lovely Dagmar Lassander, surely at her very best looking. The kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the Mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time. You were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings. It might have been better if Philippe Leroy didn't look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression. He does well though and has many silent moments where Dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. Not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different, this is certainly that.",1,it could not_have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if philippe leroy didnt look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not_an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that
"Though I did not begin to read the ""Classics"" in literature until I was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there isn't a part of the book I liked less, only parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Dalton's 'Mr. Rochester' was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah's 'Jane Eyre'. Relecting on another 'Classics' movie I saw recently, I was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. Using the title after such license is fraud. Leave it to the Brits to get this one right (among others). You won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit.

"There have been many film and TV productions of Jane Eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is utterly in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standards of that time. But, it's the performances that are the real pleasure.

"Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a would-be songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a would-be inventor. Both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's sweetheart. When Lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think that Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to implicate Mary, who goes to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this wacky murder mystery are: Lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow-witted janitor (Willie Best), Lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks Lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. It's up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer.<br /><br />The baby-voiced Wheeler and the cigar-chomping Woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny.<br /><br />Not this one. George Stevens, who went on to have a distinguished career, directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot. But two scenes are good, and both feature Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent ""Music in My Heart,"" written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time, they sing it walking up a staircase (after which they dance back down). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a jail cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through the bars.<br /><br />""The Nitwits"" has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by Woolsey's line: ""Sonny, you've got the brain of a six-year-old boy. And I'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it."" It's watered-down Grouchowho didn't use the superfluous ""even"" when he said it.",0,johnnie bert wheeler is a wouldbe songwriter newton robert woolsey is a wouldbe inventor both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building johnnie wants to sell a song to winfield lake a song publisher who also owns the building lakes secretary mary betty grable is johnnies sweetheart when lake turns up dead circumstances conspire to make mary and newton think that johnnie is the killer they conspire again to implicate mary who goes to jail but who really shot lake who is the black widow the blackmailer who had threatened him the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are lakes suspicious wife a selfsatisfied private detective a seemingly slowwitted janitor willie best lakes auditor a songwriter who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him its up to newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killerthe babyvoiced wheeler and the cigarchomping woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing but they made several movies together in the s and some of them were funnynot_this one george stevens who went on to have a distinguished career directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot but two scenes are good and both feature wheeler and betty grable singing the excellent music in my heart written by dorothy fields and jimmy mchugh the first time they sing it walking up a staircase after which they dance back down later wheeler and woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to mary who is in a jail cell on a high floor wheeler and grable sing to each other through the barsthe nitwits has a few laughs but the level of comedy is best illustrated by woolseys line sonny youve got the brain of a sixyearold boy and ill bet even he was glad to get rid of it its watereddown grouchowho didnt use the superfluous even when he said it
"Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed a lot of Brits loved it, while those in America just didn't get it. That really doesn't come as any shock, as America doesn't get what ""English"" is.<br /><br />Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. The film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. It has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. There's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. When people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...<br /><br />One quick note to those (all American so far that I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better film: Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and I think it suffered because of it. Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty, English, and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution.<br /><br />To sum up: You can keep your Chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit.

"I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up watching one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. When I do see struggling people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans that have recently arrived to the island. There is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak Spanish, or you don't.... and from what I heard... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles.<br /><br />To the person that complaint that not enough of Africa was on the show... it was suppose to be about Puerto Rico... not Africa. Denzel will make one shortly just for you.<br /><br />In conclusion... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention in Geography, and History class.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />Bocabonita... ""doc."" was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if its how we all feel.
